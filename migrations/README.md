UUIDs: Using lower(hex(randomblob(16))) for primary keys provides UUIDs compatible with D1.

Relationships: Foreign keys establish relationships (e.g., app_sites belong to scrape_apps). ON DELETE CASCADE is used where appropriate (deleting an app deletes its sites). ON DELETE SET NULL is used for request_steps and scrape_requests referencing config tables, so request history isn't lost if the config is deleted.

JSON Storage: Text fields like app_run_config, default_schema_json, agent_action_details, and extracted_data.data are intended to store JSON strings. You'll need to JSON.parse and JSON.stringify in your worker code.

Assets: The step_assets table uses storage_ref which could be an R2 object key, a reference to another D1 table storing blobs (if D1 blob support is used), or even small inline data.

Timestamps: Using DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and updated_at (which would need triggers or application logic to update).

Merging agentic_observations: You could choose to enhance agentic_observations instead of creating request_steps, adding columns like step_index, agent_goal, agent_thoughts, etc. The separate request_steps table might be cleaner for specifically tracking the structured steps vs. raw AI observations.
